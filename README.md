## Project Context
The application displays the different **computer science subjects** on the home page, including:

- Python  
- Data Structures  
- Java  
- C  

Clicking on a subject loads a dedicated page where students can access **multiple continuous assessments (CCs)** for that subject.

- Each subject initially contains **three or more CCs**
- Additional CCs can be added later
- CCs are presented as **multiple-choice quizzes**
- Answers are revealed at the end using a **“Check Answer”** feature

This allows students to **practice regularly** and **prepare effectively for exams**.
